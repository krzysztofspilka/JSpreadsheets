#### Maintenance

This is the acknowledged current master repository for SlickGrid since the MLeibman branch ceased being maintained. It builds on the current state of the mleibman/SlickGrid master branch, keeping libraries up to date and applying small, safe core patches and enhancements without turning into a personalised build.

Ben McIntyre (6pac) has maintained and continuously supported SlickGrid from before 2014 when the original SlickGrid creator had to cease support due to personal circumstances. See also the original creator's repo info page at https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid#welcome-to-slickgrid.
