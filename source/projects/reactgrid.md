description: ReactGrid is a component for displaying and entering data in a spreadsheet-like way. Reactive, cell-oriented and touch devices friendly.

> Add spreadsheet-like behavior to your React app

ReactGrid is available in two versions: MIT, which serves the full interface, 
but is limited in functionality and PRO, which is a fully functional version. 
You can compare both versions [here](https://reactgrid.com/feature-comparison). 

### Why is ReactGrid unique?

- **Reactive**

  ReactGrid is written purely in React with reactivity in mind. Rendering happens based on state changes

- **Place any cell anywhere**

  ReactGrid is fully customizable and extensible. You can literally place any cell type anywhere in the grid
  
- **Optimized for touch devices**

  ReactGrid gives the same experience to you no matter if you work on desktop or mobile devices

### ReactGrid is NOT:

* **Record-based data table**

  Looking for a data grid with Sorting, Filtering, Grouping and Spreadsheet-like edit modes?
  
  Check out these:
  - Ag-grid
  - Handsontable
  - DevExtreme DataGrid
  - Telerik Kendo UI DataTable
  
* **Spreadsheet with formulas**

  Do you need to display a fully functional spreadsheet in the browser?
  
  Have a look at Telerik Kendo UI Spreadsheet or dhtmlxSpreadsheet which have a toolbar, coordinates and support formulas.
