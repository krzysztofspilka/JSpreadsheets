nmdrTable is a pure Javascript extension of the HTML table that provides full customizable solution for representing tabular data on the web. It is part of the nmdr UI framework and supports sorting, filtering and pagination. Each cell of header, footer and body is customizable with own rendering. The data of table can be loaded dynamically through Ajax calls, so any server-side technology including PHP, ASP, Perl, Java Servlets and JSP can be used.

Take a look at this basic demo (http://nalizadeh.com/javascript/table.html) for a better insight.
